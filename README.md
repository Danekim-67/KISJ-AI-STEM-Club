 ðŸŽ¯ The primary goal of the AI STEM Club is to equip members with advanced AI prompting skills and apply these skills to real-world problems. Members will engage in discussions on recent AI issues, explore personal interests, and identify problems they wish to solve. 

ðŸ’¡ Our vision is to create a vibrant community of young innovators who are equipped to tackle pressing challenges in the modern world using AI. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, we aim to inspire students to learn AI programming skills in depth at three levels and to pursue and apply these skills in their future majors.
