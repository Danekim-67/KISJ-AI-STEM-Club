## Team UYoung Project
Hello! We are Team UYoung, a group of 5 founding high school members from Korea International School Jeju, interested in learning more about coding and AI. We are excited to introduce our passion project: KIS AI STEM Club, where we gather to explore our interests and innovate together!

There are various fields where AI can provide solutions. For our 2024-25 project, we focused on sustainability and energy to directly address solutions as students.

Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the related issue, obtain patents related to our ideas, and turn them into reality through entrepreneurship. We collaborate to create small parts of the project and support each other during our challenges to work together to pursue our dreams.


## Ongoing Projects
- Instagram Campaign https://www.instagram.com/teamuyoung/
  
This year, our team progressed the campaign through Instagram. We focused on sharing information about sustainability and energy. We uploaded posts about technologies related to our products.

- Patent in Progress

Our team's patent introduces a smart grid innovation that optimizes solar and water renewable energy, distributed efficiently to maintain optimal growing conditions in controlled environments for plant cultivation. Our product utilizes AI integration and IoT to create system features that enable user connectivity and convenience. Our technology supports a sustainable environment and provides customers with an easy agricultural experience.

- Entrepreneurship_Conrad Challenge Prep

Our team Uyoung is in the process of developing Usprout and will develop this product and receive funding. It is well worth the business to realize sustainable urban agriculture through Usprout and to give more people the opportunity to participate in agriculture easily and quickly. Through funds, profits come from product sales of our hardware and software package. We'll offer a subscription model for advanced AI features, sell consumables such as seeds/nutrients, and potentially monetize the valuable agricultural data insights gathered by our system.

ABSTRACT

The challenges of climate change and resource scarcity has highlighted the need for innovative solutions that promote sustainable living. This study focuses on conceptualizing and evaluating the feasibility of a smart farming system designed for residential use. By integrating rainwater harvesting and droplet energy conversion technologies with artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks, the proposed system aims to improve resource efficiency and support sustainable agriculture in urban households.

Building on an extensive review of existing technologies and case studies, this research incorporates insights into the functionality of rainwater harvesting systems and droplet energy conversion mechanisms, such as piezoelectric devices and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). These technologies were examined for their ability to collect rainwater, generate energy, and facilitate environmentally friendly practices in limited urban spaces. The design integrates IoT-enabled sensors and AI algorithms to track soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, optimizing irrigation, energy consumption, and crop growth. The systemâ€™s operations are envisioned to be managed through a centralized control hub, using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, with real-time adjustments available via a mobile application.

This study highlights the integration of innovative water and energy management technologies into a unified smart farming system. While the physical prototype remains under development, this research establishes a comprehensive framework for developing scalable smart farming systems. Starting at the household level, these small-scale initiatives have the potential to expand, influencing larger structures like buildings and entire urban landscapes. This project lays the groundwork for transformative contributions to urban sustainability, with future improvements in nanomaterials, AI technologies, and IoT connectivity poised to enhance the system's efficiency and broader applicability.veness of the proposed model.

## Team Goals


 ðŸŽ¯ The primary goal of the AI STEM Club is to equip members with advanced AI prompting skills and apply these skills to real-world problems. Members will engage in discussions on recent AI issues, explore personal interests, and identify problems they wish to solve. 

ðŸ’¡ Our vision is to create a vibrant community of young innovators who are equipped to tackle pressing challenges in the modern world using AI. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, we aim to inspire students to learn AI programming skills in depth at three levels and to pursue and apply these skills in their future majors.
