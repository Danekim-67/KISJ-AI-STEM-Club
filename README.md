## Team UYoung Project
Hello! We are Team UYoung, a group of 5 founding high school members from Korea International School Jeju, who are interested in learning more about coding and AI. We are excited to introduce our passion project: KIS AI STEM Club, where we gather to explore our interests and innovate together! 

There are various fields where AI can provide solutions. For our 2024-25 project, we decided to focus on sustainability and energy to directly address solutions as students. 

Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the related issue, obtain patents related to our ideas, and turn them into reality through entrepreneurship. We are collaborating to create small parts of the project and support each other during our challenges to work together to pursue our dreams. 

Our team's patent introduces a smart grid innovation that optimizes solar and water renewable energy, distributed efficiently to maintain optimal growing conditions in controlled environments for plant cultivation. Our product utilizes AI integration and IoT to create system features that enable user connectivity and convenience. Our technology not only supports green energy but also global efforts for a sustainable environment and provides customers with an easy agricultural experience.

## Team Goals


 ðŸŽ¯ The primary goal of the AI STEM Club is to equip members with advanced AI prompting skills and apply these skills to real-world problems. Members will engage in discussions on recent AI issues, explore personal interests, and identify problems they wish to solve. 

ðŸ’¡ Our vision is to create a vibrant community of young innovators who are equipped to tackle pressing challenges in the modern world using AI. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, we aim to inspire students to learn AI programming skills in depth at three levels and to pursue and apply these skills in their future majors.
